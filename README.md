# Classification of Celestial Objects from SDSS DR14
Classification of Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars (QSO) from the Sloan Digital Sky Servey (SDSS) Data Release 14 (DR14)

# Project Overview

The aim of this project is to compare two different classification methods, a traditional machine learning (ML) technique and a Neural Network (NN), using real world data from SDSS DR14. Both methods will attempt to classify Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars, something that is essential in Astronomy. Often trying to distinquish between these objects can be difficult as they are all similar "point-like" objects on the night sky, so training a ML algorithm to be able to identify them is incredibly useful.

The project is structured into three main notebooks. Question 1 focuses on explaining what a Decision Tree is and how it can be used to classify objects; Question 2 focuses on explaining how a Feed Forward Neural Network can be used; and Question 3 explores how changing certain parts of the NN in Question 2 can affect the model's performance.
